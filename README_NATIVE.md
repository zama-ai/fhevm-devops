## Getting started

### Prerequisite

Ensure that Docker (at least version 27) is installed and running.

_Optionally_ you may update `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`. Default is `false`

| KEY_GEN | Purpose                                                                                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| true    | FHE keys are generated on the fly in `res/keys`. Old keys are overwritten. This requires at elast 15GB of RAM. |
| false   | FHE keys are copied from the `kms-service-dev` image in `res/keys`                                             |

### Fast run and test

Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Run fhEVM + full KMS components
make run-full
# Deploy ACL, Gateway ..., please wait until the end before testing!!!
make prepare-e2e-test
# This test could fail (first event catch is buggy - we are on it)
make run-async-test
# This one is working
make run-async-test
# A non trivial test
make run-true-input-async-test
# Manual test
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint32'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint64'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt several addresses'
```

> [!TIP]
> If one of the tests is blocked after a few seconds, check the logs of the gateway with `docker logs zama-dev-gateway-1 -f`. If you do not see any progress after a line like
> `üçä Waiting for callback from KMS, txn_id: "85fa7..."`; **stop the test and retry**. This is a known issue and we will fix it soon!

### Trouble shooting

If you encounter

```
Error: The nonce of the deployer account is not null. Please use another deployer private key or relaunch a clean instance of the fhEVM
```

Then something went wrong in a step and you will need to run `make clean` and then start over the flow described [above](#fast-run-and-test).

### Init fhEVM-native

```bash
make init-ethermint-node
```

Initialize and generate/copy FHE keys based on `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`.

> [!NOTE]
> If `KEY_GEN` is set to `true`, ensure to have at least 15 GB of empty RAM to generate the keys. On Mac, do not forget to increase the allocated RAM to the docker process.

### Run fhEVM-native + KMS components

```bash
make run-full
# Check the logs for the node
docker logs zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1 -f
# Check logs for Gateway
docker logs zama-dev-gateway-1 -f
```

You should see the following docker images:

```
zama-dev-gateway-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:v0.8.1-rc4
zama-dev-connector-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-connector-dev:v0.8.1-rc4
zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/ethermint-node:v0.5.1
zama-dev-kms-core-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-service-dev:v0.8.1-rc4
zama-dev-kms-validator-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-asc-dev:v0.8.1-rc4
zama-dev-gateway-store-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:v0.8.1-rc4
```

### Stop fhEVM-native + KMS

```bash
make stop-full
```

### Fresh start

```bash
make clean
```

> [!NOTE]
> FHE keys are in res/keys folder, delete them to regenerate new keys at `make run-full` step.

### Test using fhevm

```bash
# if not executed before
make run-full
# In new terminal
make run-e2e-test
```

or in one command

```bash
make e2e-test
```
