## About

> [!Warning]
> This demo is an early beta version.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the integration between fhEVM and fully dockerized KMS.

The KMS encompasses all sub-components: gateway, KMS blockchain and KMS core (that can run in centralized or threshold configuration). This is stil an early version with support for (asynchronous) decryption, and reencryption.

### What is the Zama KMS for fhEVM

The Zama KMS is a full key management solution for TFHE, more specifically [TFHE-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs), based on a maliciously secure and robust [MPC protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/815).

The system facilitates this through a the use of a blockchain which provides a means of fulfilling payments to the MPC parties, along with providing an immutable audit log.

Interaction with the same KMS will happen either through an external Ethereum blockchain (fhEVM), providing an API via a smart contract, or through a gateway service.

### Implementation

The KMS is implemented as a gRPC service using the [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) crate.
Communication between full nodes and the KMS service is defined by [protobuf](/proto/kms.proto) messages.
The rest of the communication is defined by existing standards and uses JSON-RPC.
For the light client, we currently use CometBFT's [light](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cometbft/cometbft/light) package, which provides a service that connects to any CometBFT full node to serve trusted state roots on-demand.
The light client package handles the logic of sequentially verifying block headers.

## Running the demo

There are two versions of fhEVM:

- fhEVM native
- fhEVM coprocessor

### fhEVM Native

To run the demo for fhEVM native, switch [native directory](native).

### fhEVM Coprocessor

To run the demo for fhEVM native, switch [coprocessor directory](coprocessor).




## Working with KMS

### Disclaimers

#### Audits

The Zama KMS is not yet audited and should be considered in an early alpha stage. Known bugs and security issues are present as reflected by issue tracking.

#### Parameters

The default parameters for the Zama KMS are chosen to ensure a failure probability of 2^-64 and symmetric equivalent security of 132 bits.

#### Side-channel attacks

Mitigations for side-channel attacks have not been implemented directly in the Zama KMS. The smart contract of the blockchain from which calls originate is responsible to ensure the validity of calls. In particular that new ciphertexts are correctly constructed (through a proof-of-knowledge).

### Citations
