## About

> [!Warning]
> This demo is an early beta version.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the integration between fhEVM-native and a fully dockerized centralized KMS.

The KMS encompasses all sub-components, including the gateway, KMS blockchain, and centralized KMS backend. This is still an early version with support for (asynchronous) decryption, and reencryption.


### What is the Zama KMS for fhEVM
The Zama KMS is a full key management solution for TFHE, more specifically [TFHE-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs), based on a maliciously secure and robust [MPC protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/815).

The system facilitates this through a the use of a blockchain which provides a means of fulfilling payments to the MPC parties, along with providing an immutable audit log.

Interaction with the same KMS will happen either through an external Ethereum blockchain (fhEVM), providing an API via a smart contract, or through a gateway service.

### Design
Please consult the [design specification](design.md) for details on the design and the individual components.

### Implementation

The KMS is implemented as a gRPC service using the [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) crate.
Communication between full nodes and the KMS service is defined by [protobuf](/proto/kms.proto) messages.
The rest of the communication is defined by existing standards and uses JSON-RPC.
For the light client, we currently use CometBFT's [light](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cometbft/cometbft/light) package, which provides a service that connects to any CometBFT full node to serve trusted state roots on-demand.
The light client package handles the logic of sequentially verifying block headers.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite

Ensure that Docker (at least version 27) is installed and running.

_Optionally_ you may update `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`. Default is `false`

| KEY_GEN | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| true    | FHE keys are generated on the fly in `res/keys`. Old keys are overwritten. This requires at elast 15GB of RAM. |
| false   | FHE keys are copied from the `kms-service-dev` image in `res/keys` |


### Fast run and test

Execute the following commands:

```bash
# Run fhEVM + full KMS components
make run-full
# Deploy ACL, Gateway ..., please wait until the end before testing!!!
make prepare-e2e-test
# This test could fail (first event catch is buggy - we are on it)
make run-async-test
# This one is working
make run-async-test
# A non trivial test
make run-true-input-async-test
# Manual test
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint32'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint64'
cd work_dir/fhevm & npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt several addresses'
```

> [!TIP]  
> If one of the tests is blocked after a few seconds, check the logs of the gateway with `docker logs zama-dev-gateway-1 -f`. If you do not see any progress after a line like 
`üçä Waiting for callback from KMS, txn_id: "85fa7..."`; **stop the test and retry**. This is a known issue and we will fix it soon!

### Trouble shooting
If you encounter
```
Error: The nonce of the deployer account is not null. Please use another deployer private key or relaunch a clean instance of the fhEVM
```
Then something went wrong in a step and you will need to run `make clean` and then start over the flow described [above](#fast-run-and-test).

### Init fhEVM-native

```bash
make init-ethermint-node
```

Initialize and generate/copy FHE keys based on `KEY_GEN` value in `.env`.

> [!NOTE]
> If `KEY_GEN` is set to `true`, ensure to have at least 15 GB of empty RAM to generate the keys. On Mac, do not forget to increase the allocated RAM to the docker process.

### Run fhEVM-native + KMS components

```bash
make run-full
# Check the logs for the node
docker logs zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1 -f
# Check logs for Gateway
docker logs zama-dev-gateway-1 -f
```

You should see the following docker images:

```
zama-dev-gateway-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:v0.8.2-rc4
zama-dev-connector-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-connector-dev:v0.8.2-rc4
zama-dev-fhevm-validator-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/ethermint-node:v0.5.1-2
zama-dev-kms-core-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-service-dev:v0.8.2-rc4
zama-dev-kms-validator-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-asc-dev:v0.8.2-rc4
zama-dev-gateway-store-1	ghcr.io/zama-ai/kms-blockchain-gateway-dev:v0.8.2-rc4
```

### Stop fhEVM-native + KMS

```bash
make stop-full
```

### Fresh start

```bash
make clean
```

> [!NOTE]
> FHE keys are in res/keys folder, delete them to regenerate new keys at ```make run-full``` step.


### Test using fhevm

```bash
# if not executed before
make run-full
# In new terminal
make run-e2e-test
```

or in one command

```bash
make e2e-test
```

## Working with KMS

### Disclaimers

#### Audits
The Zama KMS is not yet audited and should be considered in an early alpha stage. Known bugs and security issues are present as reflected by issue tracking.

#### Parameters
The default parameters for the Zama KMS are chosen to ensure a failure probability of 2^-64 and symmetric equivalent security of 132 bits.

#### Side-channel attacks

Mitigations for side-channel attacks have not been implemented directly in the Zama KMS. The smart contract of the blockchain from which calls originate is responsible to ensure the validity of calls. In particular that new ciphertexts are correctly constructed (through a proof-of-knowledge).

### Citations
To cite the KMS in academic papers, please use the following entry:
