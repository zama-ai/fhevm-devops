This repository provides a docker based setup to locally run an integration of fhEVM blockchain and Zama KMS (Key Management System).

For overview of the system, architecture and details on individual components, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm-backend).

fhEVM blockchain comes in two variants:

- Native
- Coprocessor

KMS can be configured to two modes:

- Central
- Threshold

Possible configurations in the demo:

- fhEVM-Native variant supports running KMS in only central mode. Support for threshold mode is coming in next release.
