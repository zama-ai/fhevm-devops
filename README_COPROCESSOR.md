# What does the setup do ?

It provides a way to run a co-processor, gateway and kms (in centralized/threshold mode)
using docker compose.

The pre-computed contracts and account addresses/private keys are configured
across all the components for this test setup.

## How the repository is organized ?

- The docker compose file for KMS is defined
  [locally](./docker-compose/docker-compose-full.yml).

- Co-processor repository is cloned to work_dir and the Makefile is used for
  bringing up co-processor network.

- Solidity repository is cloned to work_dir and used from source to funding
  test accounts, deploy contracts and run tests.

- User is expected to run gateway from source.

## Prerequisites

- If there is an authentication error coming from docker.
  It maybe be that you're pulling a private image without a token.
  Go to github "Settings/Developer Settings" > "Personal Access Tokens" > "Tokens (classic)" > "Generate new token (classic)".
  The token should have the "read:packages" permission.
  Afterwards, do `docker login ghcr.io` and use your github ID and the token to login.
  Note that this token is saved by docker locally in the clear,
  so it's best to only give it the permissions you need and set the expiration time to 7 days.

### Install Binaries

Make sure you have these binaries installed in your environment:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [protobuf](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation)
- [nodejs v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

> **NB:** We will wrap all components in docker images to remove these prerequisites in the near future.

## Fast start

 If you only want to see a running setup and trigger some tests, follow the instructions.

### Centralized KMS

```bash
# Ensure in .env that CENTRALIZED_KMS=true 
make clean
./scripts/run_everything.sh
# To stop
make stop-kms-centralized-with-gateway
```

### Threshold KMS

```bash
# Ensure in .env that CENTRALIZED_KMS=false 
make clean
./scripts/run_everything.sh
# To stop
make stop-kms-threshold-with-gateway
 ```

- The different steps are:
  - Running the coprocessor + db + geth
  - Running the KMS blockchain with KMS core + KMS connector
  - Deploying the different smart contracts
  - Triggering a key-gen and crs-gen
  - RUnning the gateway (which need a working geth node)
  - Retrieve the fhe keys + crs and give them to coprocessor
  - Run a a trivial decryption test

## Steps setting up the environment  (detailed)

### 0. Set the KMS mode

Verify the configuration in .env file, most important variable is CENTRALIZED_KMS, set it to  false for threshold KMS.

| CENTRALIZED_KMS | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| true    | KMS is running in centralized mode, keys are generated by one KMS party and signer is automatically updated (default) |
| false   | KMS is running in threshold mode with 4 MPC nodes, keys are freshly generated and signers are automatically updated |

 Note: **Based on the mode the command will trigger different configurations transparently!**

### 1. Launch almost everything

```bash
make run-kms
```

The different steps are:

- Running the coprocessor + db + geth
- Running the KMS blockchain with KMS core + KMS connector
- Deploying the different smart contracts
- Triggering a key-gen and crs-gen
- Running the gateway (which need a working geth node)

üìù At this step keys are not loaded in coprocessor DB.
<details><summary> üí° Why are we starting the coprocessor if keys are not available ? </summary>

We have to do it to satisfy the gateway, gateway needs to conenct to the host BC node (geth here) in order to listen events.

We need the gateway (1) to be able to call `\keyurl` endpoint in order to retrieve the identifiers associated to each keys (publicKey, serverKey, CRS ...).

Then (2) we  download keys (with identifiers) from minio (S3 bucket like storage), see [point 2](#2-retrieve-public-key-material)

### 4. Run a simple test

```bash
make run-async-test
```

To run more test, check this [section](#testing-part).

## Running gateway from source

In a separate terminal, checkout the branch set in the .env (for instance `v0.9.0-rc28`) in kms-core repository.

### Centralized KMS configuration

Ensure to have in `<PATH_TO_KMS_CORE>/blockchain/gateway/config/gateway.toml`

```toml
# configure to match the KMS mode: centralized or threshold
mode = "centralized"

# List of prefixed of URL endpoints for the public storage of the KMS.
# The key in the map is the MPC ID of the party. I.e. [1; amount of parties]
[kms.public_storage]
1 = "http://localhost:9000/kms/PUB"
```

### Threshold KMS configuration

```toml
# configure to match the KMS mode: centralized or threshold
mode = "threshold"

# List of prefixed of URL endpoints for the public storage of the KMS.
# The key in the map is the MPC ID of the party. I.e. [1; amount of parties]
[kms.public_storage]
1 = "http://localhost:9000/kms/PUB-p1"

3 = "http://localhost:9000/kms/PUB-p3"
4 = "http://localhost:9000/kms/PUB-p4"
```

### Start the gateway

```bash
cd $path-to-kms-core
cd blockchain/gateway
cargo run --bin gateway
```

Wait for the gateway to start listening for blocks and print block numbers.

    npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint256$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt address$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt mixed$'
    ```

2. PASSING TESTS - All tests for trivial reencrypt should now pass.

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt bool$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt uint4$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt uint8$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt uint16$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt uint32$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt uint64$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt uint128$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt uint256$'
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test reencrypt address$'
    ```

3. PASSING TEST - Non trivial decrypt with input mechanism

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt uint64 non-trivial'
    ```

4. PASSING TEST - Non trivial reencrypt with input mechanism and fhe computation.

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test --grep 'test async decrypt addition uint64 non-trivial bigger value'
    ```

5. FAILING TEST - on centralized

- decryption ebytes
- reencryption ebytes

6. FAILING TEST - on threshold

- decryption ebytes, euint256
- reencryption ebytes, euint256
